# LinkedIn Games Bot

Bootstrap Chrome extension scaffold ready for future LinkedIn automation experiments.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies (none required yet).
2. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable Developer mode.
   - Click **Load unpacked** and choose this folder.
3. Open LinkedIn to see the content-script banner and use the popup button to ping the background service worker.

## Next steps

- Replace placeholder UI and banner with real automation logic.
- Add icons under an `icons/` directory and reference them from `manifest.json`.
- Wire in build tooling (TypeScript, bundler) if the project grows.

## Development

Use `npm init` or your preferred tooling when you start adding scripts or dependencies. For now, this repository intentionally stays tooling-free.
